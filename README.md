# Twitter Author ID Finder + Follower Count for Epicosm

The Epicosm code used to harvest Tweets of ALSPAC participants currently creates datasets which have the participant's Twitter author_id, but not their usernames. This code uses the user_list.txt file containing the list of ALSPAC participant user_names, and finds the author_id of these users. This means the the Epicosm generated dataset can be linked to the user list, for prepartation for use of researchers. The code also harvests the current number of followers that each participant has, which the Epicosm program current does not do.

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
